The requirements are needed to complete the signing are the following: 1.) individual clearance form 2.) Library card with 1 x 1 attached ID picture as required.</p>
                    
                    <p>It should be known by the students that a sanction will be imposed for those students who late submit their clearance. The kind of sanction is given upon the discretion of the University Librarian.</p>
                             
                    <p>The schedule for the signing of clearance should be strictly followed since the library will conduct activities like the inventory of library books and other materials as well as the equipment, processing and cataloging of books, and distribution. The Commission On Audit (COA) strictly requires the library to submit the said documents before summer will end.</p>
